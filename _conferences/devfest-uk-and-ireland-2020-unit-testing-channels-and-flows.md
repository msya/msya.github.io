Unit testing Channels and Flows can be a challenge as they are fairly new. In this talk, I will share with you how to implement and test practical examples from my experience. These examples are testing delays, retries, and errors. I'll also share testing more complex examples such as polling. For each use case, we'll look at how to use features in the coroutines library such as runBlockingTest and TestCoroutineDispatcher. From my journey of using and testing Flows in production, I'll share the challenges I experienced.

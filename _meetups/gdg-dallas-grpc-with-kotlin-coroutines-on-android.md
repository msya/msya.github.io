In this talk, I will share with you how to build a gRPC server using the gRPC-Kotlin library. We’ll explore how to use protocol buffers to define different types of rpc calls that are unary and bidirectional. On the client side, we’ll also use this library to consume our gRPC service. gRPC-Kotlin provides an API that uses Flows to make rpc calls. We’ll explore how it works internally. For each rpc call we implement using coroutines, I’ll show you how to unit test it.

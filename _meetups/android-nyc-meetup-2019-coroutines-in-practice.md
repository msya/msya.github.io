To implement asynchronous logic, many devs use RxJava. But, Kotlin provides us with another toolset called Coroutines. I have been integrating Coroutines at Vimeo. In this talk, I will share with you my journey and the challenges I encountered. We will look at how to handle simple to complex uses cases with Coroutines. Some of these use cases are bridging a callback based SDK to coroutines, using Coroutines with MVP, handling polling and writing tests. I'll also show the usage of actors, channels and supervisor scope in real examples. Please join me to learn about my ongoing journey to introduce coroutines in an app.

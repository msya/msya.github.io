Mohit will share with you best practices for testing Channels and Flows. He will show practical use cases where we have to handle retries, errors and delays. For each of these scenarios, he will show you patterns to use for testing. We will look at features of the coroutine testing library such as advancing time forward. We will also look at ways to do assertions on a Flow.

In this talk, I will presented on how to use constructs such as actors, channels and flows in use cases. These use cases are modeling streams with channels and flows and using actors to ensure one concurrent job is running. Channels and Flows are experimental features that allow us to represent a stream of data. Flows represent a cold stream whereas a Channel is like a hot observable. Weâ€™ll dive into these topics.

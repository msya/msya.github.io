Micronaut is a full-stack framework for building microservices. The framework offers fast startup time, low memory consumption, efficient compile-time dependency injection, and it is designed to build resilient microservices. Micronaut also has Kotlin coroutines support. In this talk, we'll explore how to build microservices with coroutines. We'll look at use cases for using suspending functions, scopes, and dispatchers in your controller with Micronaut. We'll also dive into how to test your microservice. By the end of this talk, you'll have a good starting point to use Micronaut with coroutines.

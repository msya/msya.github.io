GraphQL is a query language for APIs developed by Facebook. It allows you to retrieve only the data you need by sending a GraphQL query on the client side. In this talk, I will show you how you could integrate GraphQL with Kotlin on the server. I will demonstrate how to use the Java implementation of the GraphQL specifications with Kotlin extensions. Through examples, I will show the benefits of GraphQL versus a traditional REST API implementation.

2019 maybe be the year of Kotlin coroutines. What is a coroutine anyway? A coroutine is an instance of a state machine and a suspending function defines the state machine. What does that mean? Join me in this talk as we will explore the ins and out of coroutines. We will dive deep into channels, actors and the reactive streams modules. Weâ€™ll also look at their usage to solve common async problems in Android.

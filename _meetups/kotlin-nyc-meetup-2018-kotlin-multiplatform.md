This presentation is a walk through on how to build a multiplatform app for Android & iOS. We look at how to structure and setup a project for Android and iOS. Then, we look how to a build an Android & iOS app with this structure. The sample app is built using Model View Presenter. We explore how to share our models and presenters in a multiplatform project. We also look at the limitations that you will come across along the way.

In this talk, Mohit will present on how to use constructs such as channels and flows in various use cases. These use cases are modeling streams that are hot or cold, multicasting, polling, handling errors and testing. A Channel is similar to a blocking queue or a subject from RxJava. There are different types of channels that fit different use cases. On the other hand, a Flow represents a cold stream. We’ll look at how they work and thier APIs for consuming and producing a stream. I also cover how to go by testing your code using the coroutines testing library that is provided. I’ll share various helper extensions that you could use to improve your testing. By the end of this talk, you will have expanded your toolset for solving problems using Coroutines.

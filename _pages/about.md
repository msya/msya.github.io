I was an early adopter of Kotlin. I started using the language 8 years ago. I have helped integrate it at three different companies so far with small to large teams with different challenges. I've also helped companies to adopt Coroutines. In this journey, I'm also an author of a book on Coroutines. I have shared my learnings and obstacles through conference and meetup talks and blog posts.

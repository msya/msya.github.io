I am a [Google Developer Expert](https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory/profile/profile-mohit_sarveiya) in Kotlin and Android. I was an early adopter of Kotlin. I have helped to integrate it at  different companies with varying team sizes with different challenges. I've also helped companies to adopt Coroutines. In this journey, I have shared my learnings and obstacles through talks and blog posts.
